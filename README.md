I have been able partially implement my sign up page on this assignment. The signup page came from w3schools and is also refrenced in my code. I am now working on getting the page to interact with the server as i need the details imported to be able to save the the mySQL data base.
I have started to implement my products page as I got a grid from W3schools that allows me to set the products page up nicely. For now, I am hard coding it in just so I can get my structure but after I have done so I will use the statements to pull it from the database.
I have pulled my products from the server using the necessary SELECT statement, it has all pulled but the images are not showing meaning there may be a problem with how the images are stored on the server. I will aim to complete that today.
